        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>My name is Seth LaFountain. I am a veteran of the United States Navy. During my six year enlistment, I went to wonderful places like Kuwait and Afghanistan, exactly the types of places I thought I'd go when I joined the Navy.<sub>1</sub> Jokes aside, it was a good growing experience all in all. After separating, I continued my work as an electronics technician for a short while, and soon realized that that was not what I wanted to do any longer. At that point I went to school and received my undergrad in finance and Masters in Business Administration. The last six years or so following school, I haven't really had a sturdy job; I've basically provided for myself through trading the stock market and playing poker at a high level. Both of these ventures have been great at times, and really tough at times; the monetary swings can be insane. I've recently come to the realization that I need something more sturdy to support my family as we just recently had a baby girl named Faith and she deserves more from me. This is why I'm here with hopes of learning to program/code and becoming efficient enough with it to land some sort of employment. This field really interests me. I hope that my knowledge in programming can increase exponentially; for example, if my current knowledge in the field = x, after this course I'd like it to equal x<sup>2</sup> or potentially even x<sup>10</sup>!</p>
